# collaging_machine

Note: this doesn't resize the pics, so the output might be quite large (good for printing - there's a small chance this might produce something that's nice enough to print, with the least possible loss of data.. it should be mentioned that this can handle more than just 2 pic sizes/shapes (eg portrait and landscapes of the same area))

layout() decides which orientation (up/down or left/right) to use as the main axis, and throws up the most awkward cases

draw() finds a good way of placing the pics on collage
